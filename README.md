# KVS++ Cloud

KVS++ Cloud is a modern web platform built to showcase and extend the capabilities of the original [KVS++](https://github.com/awesohame/kvsplusplus) project - a high-performance, multi-store key-value system written in C++. This website provides a user-friendly interface for managing stores, access, and API tokens, making it easier to interact with KVS++ from anywhere.

## What is KVS++?
KVS++ (Key Value Store in C++) is a robust, scriptable, and fast key-value database designed for automation, integration, and extensibility. It features multi-store support, a powerful TCP server, and a flexible CLI, making it ideal for developers and power users who need reliable data storage and automation tools.

KVS++ Cloud brings these features to the web, allowing you to:
- View and manage your stores visually
- Control access and permissions
- Generate and manage API tokens
- Explore logs and settings
